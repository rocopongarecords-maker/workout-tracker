    "Weigh first thing in the morning, after using the bathroom, before eating or drinking",
    "Wear the same clothing (or none) each time for consistency",
    "Use the same scale on a hard, flat surface every time",

    "Track a 7-day rolling average for the most accurate trend reading"

  tips: [
    "Always measure on the RIGHT side of the body for consistency",
    "Take 3 readings per site and use the MEDIAN value (middle value)",
    "Pinch the skin firmly, pull away from the muscle, and place caliper 1 cm below the pinch",
    "Read the caliper after 2 seconds — don't wait too long or the fat compresses",
    "Always measure before exercise (sweat and increased blood flow affect readings)",
    "Use the same person to take measurements each time if possible"
